Nationdex is a bot for collecting countryballs on Discord and exchange them with your friends, just like any other dex, but with more freedom and less interventions.

You can invite our bot [here](https://discord.com/application-directory/1207017704096141312), with all the credits to [Ballsdex](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=999736048596816014&permissions=537193536&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

Ariel Aram is banned from Ballsdex server under immediate decision from **thebicfish** to take strict measures for the last involvement of both of them and some other people in the AsiaDex drama on September 2024, but we are still providing the Ballsdex official server due to our explicit association with Ballsdex.
