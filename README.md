Nationdex is a bot for collecting countryballs on Discord and exchange them with your friends, just like any other dex, but with more freedom and less interventions.

You can invite our bot [here](https://discord.com/application-directory/1207017704096141312), with all the credits to [Ballsdex](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=999736048596816014&permissions=537193536&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
